# 18-mongodb-mongoose-backend

## description

For this assignment we were tasked with creating a social media backend using mongodb and mongoose. At first this assignment was a little intimidating because we had just learned mysql and switching over to mongo took some time. But after really going back and studying the concepts the code came naturally. Mongo seems to flow in my opinion a lot smoother than mysql. I really enjoyed taking on this challenge.
